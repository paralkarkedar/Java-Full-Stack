Marker interface
===============
Interface which does not have any methods or constants is called marker interface.

In general, empty interface is called marker interface.

Using marker interface we will get some ability to do.

We have following marker interface.

ex:
	Serializable 
	Cloneable 
	Remote 
	and etc.

class  Student implements java.io.Serializable 
{
	private int studId;

	//setter method 
	public void setStudId()
	{
		this.studId=studId;
	}
	//gettter method 
	public int getStudId()
	{
		return studId;
	}
}


Abstract class
===============
Abstract class is a collection of zero or more abstract methods and concrete methods.

A abstract keyword is applicable for methods and classes but not for variables.

It is not possible to create object for abstract class.

To write the implementation of abstract methods of abstract class we will use sub class.

By default every abstract method is a public and abstract.

Abstract class contains only instance variables.

We can declare abstract class as follow.

syntax:
-------
	abstract class  <class_name>
	{
		-
		- // abstract methods 
		- // concrete methods 
		- // instance variables 	
		-	
	}

If we know partial implementation then we need to use abstract class.


ex:
----

abstract class Plan 
{
	//instance variable
	protected double rate;

	//abstract method
	public abstract void getRate();

	//concrete method
	public void getBillDetails(int units)
	{
		System.out.println("Total Units :"+units);
		System.out.println("Total Bill :"+ units*rate);
	}
}
class DomesticPlan extends Plan 
{
	public void getRate()
	{
		rate=2.5d;
	}
}
class CommercialPlan extends Plan
{
	public void getRate()
	{
		rate=5.0d;
	}
}
class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		DomesticPlan dp=new DomesticPlan();
		dp.getRate();
		dp.getBillDetails(250);

		CommercialPlan cp=new CommercialPlan();
		cp.getRate();
		cp.getBillDetails(250);
	}
}


Q) What is the difference between interface and abstract class?

interface					abstract class
---------------					---------------
To declare interface we will use interface 	To declare abstract class we will use abstract

Abstraction
============
Hiding internal implementation and highlighting the set of services is called abstraction.

Using interface and abstract class we can implements abstraction.

ex:
	GUI ATM Machine 

ex:
---
abstract class Animal
{
	//abstract method
	public abstract void sound();
}
class Cat extends Animal
{
	public void sound()
	{
		System.out.println("Meow Meow");
	}
}
class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Cat c=new Cat();
		c.sound();
	}
}

ex:
---
abstract class Animal
{
	//abstract method
	public abstract void sound();

	//concrete method 
	public static void behaviour()
	{
		System.out.println("Eating+Jumping+Sleeping");
	}
}
class Cat extends Animal
{
	public void sound()
	{
		System.out.println("Meow Meow");
	}
}
class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Cat c=new Cat();
		c.sound();
		c.behaviour();
	}
}


API
====
API stands for Application Programming Interface.

API is a base for the programmer to develop software applications.

API is a collection of packages.

We have three set of API's.

1) Predefined API 
---------------
	Built-In API is called predefined API.
	ex:
		https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/

2) Userdefined API 
----------------
	API which is created by the user based on the application requirement.
	

3) Third party API 
--------------
	API which is created by using third party vendor.
	ex:
		javazoom API
		iText API 
		and etc.



Package
========
A package is a collection of classes, interfaces , enums and annotations.

Here enum is a special class and annotation is a special interface.

In general, a package is a collection of classes and interfaces.

A package is also known as folder or directory.

In java, we have two types of packages.

1) Predefined packages 

2) Userdefined packages 

1) Predefined packages 
-----------------------
Built-in packages are called predefined packages.
ex:
	java.lang
	java.io
	java.time
	java.text
	java.util
	java.util.stream
	and etc.

2) Userdefined packages 
----------------------
A package which is created by the user based on the application requirement is called userdefined
package.

To declare custom package we need to use "package" keyword.

It is always recommanded to declare package name inthe reverse order of url.

syntax:
	package   <package_name>;

ex:
	package   com.qualitythought.www;
	package   com.google.www;
	package   com.ihubtalent.www; 


ex:
---
package  com.ihub.www;
import java.util.Calendar;
class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Calendar c=Calendar.getInstance();

		int h=c.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY);

		if(h<12)
			System.out.println("Good Morning");
		else if(h<16)
			System.out.println("Good Afternoon");
		else if(h<20)
			System.out.println("Good Evening");
		else 
			System.out.println("Good Night");
	}
}

We can compile above program by using below command.
ex:

		current directory 
		      |
	javac   -d    .     Test.java
		|
	destination location 	


We can run above program by using below command.
ex:
				classname 
				|
	java    com.ihub.www.Test
			| 
		package name 

Singleton class
===============
A class which allows us to create only one object is called singleton class.

If we call any method by using class name and that method returns same class object is called 
singleton class.

ex:
	LocalDate date=LocalDate.now();
	LocalTime time=LocalTime.now();
	Calendar c=Calendar.getInstance();

To create a singleton class we required private constructor and static method.

ex:
---
class Singleton 
{
	static Singleton singleton=null;

	private Singleton()
	{
	}

	public static  Singleton  getInstance()
	{
	
		if(singleton==null)
		{
			singleton=new Singleton();
		}

		return singleton;
	}
}

class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Singleton s1=Singleton.getInstance();
		System.out.println(s1.hashCode());

		Singleton s2=Singleton.getInstance();
		System.out.println(s2.hashCode());
	}
}
