Naming Convention in java
=========================
In java, uppercase letters will consider as different and lowercase letters will consider as difference.Hence we consider java is a case sensitive programming language.

As java is a case sensitive, we must and should follow naming conventions for following things.

ex:
	classes
	interfaces
	variables
	methods
	keywords
	packages
	constants 

classes
----------
In java, a class name must starts with uppercase letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must and should starts with initcap.

ex:
	predefined classes		userdefined classes
	-------------------		-------------------
	System				Test
	File				DemoApp 
	FileWriter			ExampleApp
	BufferedReader 			ScannerDemo
	and etc.			and etc.

interfaces
----------
In java, an interface name must starts with uppercase letter and if it contains multiple words then 
each inner word must and should starts with initcap.

ex:
	predefined interfaces		userdefined interfaces
	-----------------------		----------------------
	Runnable 			ITest
	Serializable 			IDemoApp
	ListIterator 			IExampleDemo
	Enumeration 			ITestApp
	and etc.			and etc.


variables
----------
In java, a variable name must starts with lowercase letter and if it contains multiple words 
then each inner word must and should starts with initcap.

ex:
	predefined variables		userdefined variables
	-------------------		---------------------
	out				empId
	in				studName
	err				deptNo
	length 				courseFee
	and etc.			and etc.


methods
-------
In java, a method name must starts with lowercase letter and if it contains multiple words then 
each inner word must and should starts with uppercase letter.

ex:
	predefined methods			userdefined methods
	------------------			-------------------
	getPriority()				getStudentInfo()
	hashCode()				calculateBillAmt()
	toString()				demoApp()
	getClass()				setDetails()
	and etc.				and etc.


keywords
---------
In java, all keywords we need to declare under lowercase letters only.

ex:
	predefined keywords
	------------------
	class, public, static, void , if, else, for, switch and etc.	

packages
--------
In java, all packages we need to declare under lowercase letters only.

ex:
	predefined packages		userdefined packages
	------------------		--------------------
	java.lang			com.shiva.www
	java.util			com.google.www	
	java.io				com.ihub.www
	java.util.stream		and etc.
	java.text
	java.time
	and etc.

constants 
---------
In java, all constants we need to declare under uppercase letters only.

ex:
	predefined constants		userdefined constants
	----------------		---------------------
	MAX_PRIORITY			int LIMIT=10;
	MIN_PRIORITY
	NORM_PRIORITY
	MAX_VALUE
	MIN_VALUE
	and etc.
