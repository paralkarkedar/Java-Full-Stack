History of Java
================
In 1990 , Sun Micro System took one project to develop a software called consumer electronic device which can be controlled by a remote like setup box.That time project was called Stealth project and later it is renamed to Green project.

James Gosling, Mike Sheradin and Patrick Naughton were there to develop the project. They met in a place called Aspan/Colarado to start the work with Graphic System.James Gosling thought to use C and C++ languages to develop the project.But the problem what they have faced is C and C++ languages are system dependent. Then James Gosling decided why don't we create our own programming language which i system independent.

In 1991, they have developed a programming language called an OAK. OAK means strength, itself is a coffee seed name and it is a national three for many countries like Germany, France, USA and etc.

Later in 1995, they have renamed OAK to Java. Java is a island of an Indonasia where first coffee of seed was produced and during the development of project they were consuming lot of coffee's.Hence a symbol of java is a cup of coffee with saucer.

Java Source File Structure 
===========================
case1:
------
	A java program can have mulitiple classes.


case2:
------
	If a java program contains multiple classes then we need to check which class contains 
	main method and that class treated as main class.
	ex:
		Test.java
		-----------
		class A 
		{
			//some logic
		}
		class Test
		{
			public static void main(String[] args)
			{
				//some logic
			}	
		}

case3:
------
	If a java program contains multiple classes with main method then we need to declare 
	one class as public.That public class will treated as main class.

	ex:
		A.java
		--------		
		public class A
		{
			public static void main(String[] args)
			{
				System.out.println("A-class");	
			}	
		}
		class B
		{
			public static void main(String[] args)
			{
				System.out.println("B-class");	
			}	
		}
		class C
		{
			public static void main(String[] args)
			{
				System.out.println("B-class");	
			}	
		}
		We can compile above program with below command.
		ex:
			javac   A.java  (Here A.class, B.class and C.class file will be created)

		We can run above program with below commands.
		ex:
			java   A  (A class will execute)					
			java   B  (B class will execute)
			java   C  (C class will execute)
