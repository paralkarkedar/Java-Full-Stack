Types of Applications
=====================
We have two types of applications.

1) Client based application 

2) Web based application 


1) Client based application
----------------------------
Application which need to be installed in a user's computer is called client based application.
 
In general, Applications which are running in a user's computer is called client based application.

Client based applications are used by perticular user.

All client based applications are ruled out.

Ex:
	VLC Media player 	
	MS-Office 



2) Web based application 
--------------------------
Application which can access from anywhere over the network is called web based application.
ex:
	Amazon 
	Facebook 
	and etc.


Q) How can we develop an application accessible by thousands of users?

First we need to develop an application and later we need to host that application on the top of the server.

Diagram: aws1.1



Q) Will company use one server or multiple servers?

It depends upon scale of a company because companies revenue is depends upon these machines. A company make sure these servers operate all the time.



Q) What is the difference between PC and server?

PC 							Server
-------------						--------------
It is designed for perticular user.			It is designed to operate multiple users.

It contains less storage from gigabytes to 		It contains high storage from terabytes to 
terabytes.						petabytes.

It contains simple structure.				It contains complex structure.

Low network capability.					High network capability.

It contains one processor.				It contains multiple processors.



To develop an application on the top of the server we need to create a infrastructure.

Each and every IT company contains data center.

A data center is a place where we can host all our servers.

Maintaining a data center is very complicated.

1) Required secure and private place.

2) Required 24/7 power supply.

3) Required Dual Network.

4) Required server maintainence team.

5) Need to maintain cool temperature.

6) Need to follow geographical standards for customer data which contains physical secure and 
   network security.

7) Hardware Refresh 

and etc.



Q) What is cloud computing ?

It is a on demand delivery of IT resources with pay-as-you go model.

We have following list of clouds.
ex:
	AWS
	Microsoft Azure 
	GCP 
	IBM cloud 
	Alibaba cloud 
	and etc.

We have following list of cloud providers.
ex:
	Amazon 
	Microsoft
	Google
	IBM
	Alibaba 
	and etc.


Q) What is AWS ?

AWS stands for Amazon Web Services.

It is one of the leading cloud service provider accross the world.

It provides infrastructure as a service.

From 2004 to 2014 they are monopoly in industry.

Today 70% to 80% customers are AWS customers.

In 2014 , microsoft Azure came in to a picture.



Types of Cloud Business/Service Models
=====================================
We have three types of cloud business/service models.

1) IaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

2) PaS (Platform as a Service)

3) SaS (Software as a Service)

All the cloud provides deals with above business/service models.

They comes up and ends up with shared responsibility model.

Some group of expertise engineers will decide which model they need to use for organization.
