JavaScript syntax
================

<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
		-
		- //set of statements
		-
</script>


ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
			document.write("Hello World");
		</script>
</body>
</html>

Note:
	Here type and language attribute is optional to declare.
	Here ';' semicolon is not mandatory because it a loosely typed checking language.

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			document.write("Hello World JavaScript")
		</script>
</body>
</html>

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			document.writeln("Welcome to IHUB");
			document.writeln("This is javascript class");
		</script>
</body>
</html>

note:
	Using document.writeln() we will get space at the end of the statement.


ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			document.writeln("Welcome to IHUB");
			<br>
			document.writeln("This is javascript class");
		</script>
</body>
</html>

Note:
-----
	We can't declare markup language inside scripting language.

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			document.writeln("Welcome to IHUB");
			document.writeln("<br>");
			document.writeln("This is javascript class");
		</script>
</body>
</html>

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			document.writeln("<h1 style='color:red'>Welcome to IHUB</h1>");
			document.writeln("<br>");
			document.writeln("<p style='font-size:30px;text-align:center'>This is javascript class</p>");
		</script>
</body>
</html>

Note:
-----
	If we have HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a single file then it is called DHTML.
	DHTML stands for Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language.


JavaScript Engine
==================
It allows to execute scripting language in a browser window.

It is used to converts user understandable scripting language to machine understandable scripting language.

Every browser contains javascript engine.

ex:
	Browser 		JavaScript Engine
	--------		-----------------
	Chrome			V8 Engine 
	Mozilla			SpiderMonkey
	Edge			Chakra 
	and etc.


Comments in JavaScript
========================
Comments are created for ducumentation purpose.

Comments improves the readability of javascript code.

JavaScript engine will not display javascript comments in a web page.

We have two types of comments in javascript.

1) Single Line comment 
----------------------
	It is used to comment a single line.
	ex:
		// comment here 
		

2) Multiple Line comment 
---------------------
	It is used to comment multiple lines.
	It is more convenient because we can comment single line as well as multiple lines.
	ex:
		/*
			-
			-
			-
		*/

Output statements
=================
In javascript, output statements are used to display userdefined statements or data.

We have two types of output statements in javascript.

1) document.writeln() 

2) console.log()  

1) document.writeln() 
---------------------
It is used to display the output on browser window.

ex:
--
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			document.writeln("Browser Output");
		</script>
</body>
</html>


2) console.log()  
----------------
It is used to display the output on browser console.

ex:
--
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			console.log("Console Output");
		</script>
</body>
</html>

Types of variables in JavaScript
================================
A name which is given to a memory location is called variable.

Purpose of variable is used to store the data.

In Javascript, variable is also known as identifier.

Javascript variables having same rules as we have for identifiers.

Rules to declare javascript variables
---------------------------------------
Rule1:
-----
	Javascript variable can starts with alphabet, underscore or dollar symbol 
	but no with digits.
	ex:
		var abc;
		var _abcd;
		var $abcd;

Rule2:
-----
	After first alphabet it can have any number of digits.
	ex:
		var  a1234;  
		var  1abcd; //invalid 

Rule3:
-----
	Every javascript variable is a case sensitive.
	ex:
		var  number;
		var  NUMBER;

In javascript, variables are divided into two types.

1) Local variables 

2) Global variables 

1) Local variables 
---------------------
A variable which is declare inside the function or a block is called local variable.

Local variable can access within the function only.

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			function f1()
			{
				//local variable
				var i=10;

				document.writeln(i);		
			}
			//calling 
			f1();
		</script>
</body>
</html>

ex:
--
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			function f1()
			{
				//local variable
				var i=10;

				document.writeln(i);		
			}

			function f2()
			{
				document.writeln(i);
			}

			//calling 
			f1();
			f2();
		</script>
</body>
</html>

2) Global variables
--------------------
A variable which is declare outside the function or a block is called global variable.

Global variable we can access within the function and outside the function.

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			//global variable 
			var i=20;

			function f1()
			{
				document.writeln(i);			
			}

			//calling 
			f1();
			
		</script>
</body>
</html>

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			//global variable 
			var i=20;

			function f1()
			{
				document.writeln(i+"<br>");			
			}
			function f2()
			{
				document.writeln(i+"<br>");
			}

			//calling 
			f1();
			f2();
		</script>
</body>
</html>
