Types of Data
==============
We have two types of data.

1) Unstructured Data 

2) Structured Data 

1) Unstructured Data 
---------------------
A data which is not in readable format is called unstructured data.

In general, meaningless data is called unstructured data.

ex:
	201   Lakemba    SYD     NSW     AUS


2) Structured Data 
------------------
A data which is in readable format is called structured data.

In general, meaning full data is called structured data.

ex:
	Unit  Locality	 City    State   Country
	----  --------   -----   -----   --------
	201   Lakemba    SYD     NSW     AUS


Management system 
=================
Management system is a software which is used to manage the database.

Using management system we can perform following activities very easily.

1) Adding the new data 

2) Modifying the existing data 

3) Dropping the unnecessary data 

4) Selecting the required data 


Q) What is the difference between DBMS and RDBMS?

DBMS						RDBMS
--------					-----------
It stands for Database Management System.	It stands for Relational Database Management 
						System.

It stores the data in files.			It stores the data in tables.

It is not designed to store large amount of	It is designed to store large amount of data. 
data.

It provides support for single user at a time.	It provides support for multiple users at a time.

There is no data security.			There is high data security.	

It does not support normalization.		It supports normalization.
						(It reduce code redundency)


Oracle
=======
It is one of the database which is used to store structured data.

It is a RDBMS database.

It is product of Oracle Corporation.

It is classified into two types.

					Oracle
					|
		|--------------------------------------------------------|
		SQL							PL/SQL
	(Structured Query Language)			(Procedural / Structured Query Language)




Client-Server Architecture 
==========================
Diagram: oracle1.1

Above architecture describes how our frontend data goes to backend.

FrontEnd
---------
The one which is visible to the enduser to perform some operations is called frontend.
ex:
	Java,.Net,Python,Perl,D2K and etc.

Communication channel
------------------
It acts like a bridge between frontend and backend.
ex:
	JDBC- Java Database Connectivity
	ODBC- Open Database Connectivity
	PDBC- Python Database Connectivity 

BackEnd
--------
The one which is not visible to the enduser but it performs operations based on the instructions
given by frontend is called backend.
ex:
	Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB , NoSQL and etc.

SQL
====
SQL stands for Structured Query Language which is pronounce as SEQUEL.

This language is used to interact with oracle database.

It is a command based language.

It is a case insensitive language.

Every command must starts with verb.

Every command must ends with semicolon.

It is developed in the year 1972 by Mr.Codd (by IBM).


Sub languages of SQL
====================
We have five sub languages of SQL.

1) DDL (Data Definition Language)

2) DML (Data Manipulation Language)

3) DRL/DQL (Data Retrieve/Query Language)

4) TCL (Transaction Control Language)

5) DCL (Data Control Language)


1) DDL (Data Definition Language)
-------------------------------
This language is used to maintain the objects in database.

It is a collection of five commands.

ex:
	create, alter, drop , truncate and rename.


2) DML (Data Manipulation Language)
-----------------------------------
This language is used to manipulate the data which is present in database.

It is a collection of four commands.

ex:
	insert, update, delete and merge 



3) DRL/DQL (Data Retrieve/Query Language)
------------------------------------
This language is used to retrieve the data from database.

It is a collection of one command.

ex:
	select 


4) TCL (Transaction Control Language)
---------------------------------------
This language is used to maintain the transaction of database.

It is a collection of three commands.

ex:
	commit, rollback and savepoint 



5) DCL (Data Control Language)
------------------------------
This language is used to control the access of data to the user.

It is a collection of two commands.

ex:
	grant and revoke 




Table
=====
Table is an object which is used to represent the data.

Table is a collection of rows and columns.

Data which is present in a table is a case sensitive.

ex:
	NO		NAME		ADD
	---------------------------------------
	101	|	Alan	|	Florida
	---------------------------------------
	102	|	Jose	|	Texas 
	---------------------------------------
	103	|	Lisa	|	Chicago
	---------------------------------------

	Here table contains 3 rows and 3 columns.
