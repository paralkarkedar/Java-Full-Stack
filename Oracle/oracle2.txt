Establish the connection with database
======================================
To execute any comment in database or to perform any operation on database we need to 
establish the connection with database software.

Once work with database is completed we need to close the connection with database.

ex:
---
	SQL> connect 
		username : system 
		password : admin 

	SQL> disconnect 

ex:
----
	SQL> conn
		username : system 
		password : admin 

	SQL> disc

ex:
---
	SQL> conn system/admin
	SQL> disc 



create command
==============
It is used to create a table in a database.

syntax:
------
	create table <table_name>(col1 datatype(size),col2 datatype(size),......,
					colN datatype(size));

ex:
	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	create table dept(deptno number(3),dname varchar2(10),dloc varchar2(10));

	create table emp(eid number(3),ename varchar2(10),esal number(10,2),
				deptno number(3),job varchar2(10),comm number(8));




Describe command
================
It is used to display the structure of a table.

syntax:
	desc  <table_name>;

ex:
	desc  emp;
	desc  dept;
	desc  student;



Insert command
===============
Insert command is used to insert row/record in a table.

syntax:
------
	insert into <table_name> values (value1,value2,....,valueN);

ex:
	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');
	
	insert into student values('ravi',102,'delhi'); //invalid 

	insert into student values(102,'ravi'); // invalid  

	insert into student values(102,'ravi',null); 

Note:
-----
	null represent undefined or unavailable.

approach2
---------
	insert into student(sno,sname,sadd) values(103,'ramana','vizag');

	insert into student(sno,sname) values(104,'ramulu');


approach3
---------
	Using '&' symbol we can insert dynamic inputs.

	ex:
		insert into student values(&sno,'&sname','&sadd');


commit command
==============
It is used to make the changes permanent to database.

syntax:
	commit; 


dept table

insert into dept values(10,'CSE','HYD');
insert into dept values(20,'ECE','PUNE');
insert into dept values(30,'MEC','VIZAG');
insert into dept values(40,'EEE','DELHI');
commit;


emp table
==========
create table emp(eid number(3),ename varchar2(10),esal number(10,2),
				deptno number(3),job varchar2(10),comm number(8));

insert into emp values(201,'Alan',9000,10,'Clerk',null);
insert into emp values(202,'Jose',19000,10,'Clerk',500);

insert into emp values(203,'Kelvin',45000,20,'HR',300);
insert into emp values(204,'Nelson',23000,20,'HR',900);
