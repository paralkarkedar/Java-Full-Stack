Merge command
=============
Merge command is possible by using update and insert command.

ex:

student10 table
---------------
drop table student10;
create table student10(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));
insert into student10 values(101,'raja','hyd');
insert into student10 values(102,'ravi','delhi');
insert into student10 values(103,'ramana','vizag');
commit;

student20 table
---------------
drop table student20;
create table student20(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));
insert into student20 values(103,'Alan','Florida');
insert into student20 values(104,'John','Texas');
commit;


merge into student10 s1
using student20 s2
ON(s1.sno=s2.sno)
when matched then 
update set sname=s2.sname,sadd=s2.sadd
when not matched then 
insert(sno,sname,sadd) values(s2.sno,s2.sname,s2.sadd);
 
select * from student10;

select * from student20;


Sub Queries
============
We will declare a query inside another query such concept is called sub query.

In sub query , first inner query will execute then outer query.

Sub queries are used to select the records based on unknown values.

We have following list of sub queries.

1) Single Row subquery

2) Multiple Row subquery

3) Multiple Column subquery 


1) Single Row subquery
-----------------------
If a sub query returns only one row is called single row sub query.

Sub queries can be nested upto 32 levels.

ex:
	SQL
	----
		select * from emp where eid=201;

	Subquery
	--------
		select * from emp where eid=(select eid from emp where ename='Alan');

ex:
	SQL
	---
		select * from emp where eid=201 and ename='Alan';

	Subquery
	---------	
		select * from emp where eid=(select eid from emp where ename='Alan')
		 and ename=(select ename from emp where esal=9000);


Q) Write a query to display employees information whose salary is greater then mark salary?

	
	select * from emp where esal>(select esal from emp where ename='Mark');



Q) Write a query to display second highest salary from emp table?

	select max(esal) from emp where esal<(select max(esal) from emp);	


2) Multiple Row subquery
---------------------
If a sub query returns more then one row is called multiple row sub query.

To perform multiple row sub query we need to use multiple row operators.

We have three multiple row operators.

i) ANY 

ii) ALL 

iii) IN 

i) ANY 
-----
	select * from emp where esal > ANY (select esal from emp where deptno=10);
	select * from emp where esal < ANY (select esal from emp where deptno=10);

ii) ALL 
------
	select * from emp where esal > ALL (select esal from emp where deptno=10);
	select * from emp where esal < ALL (select esal from emp where deptno=10);
	
iii) IN 
---------
	select * from emp where esal IN (select esal from emp where deptno=10);
	

3) Multiple Column subquery 
--------------------------
If a sub query returns more then one column is called multiple column subquery.

ex:

select * from emp where(eid,ename,esal)  IN (select eid,ename,esal from emp where eid=201);

select eid,ename,esal from emp where(eid,ename,esal)  IN (select eid,ename,esal from emp where eid=201);

select eid,ename,esal from emp where(eid,ename,esal)  IN (select eid,ename,esal from emp);


Assignment
===========

Q) Write a query to display last three records from emp table?

SELECT * FROM ( SELECT * FROM emp ORDER BY eid DESC) WHERE ROWNUM <= 3 order by eid;


Q) What is the difference between RDBMS and MongoDB?

RDBMS							MongoDB
-------------						-----------
It is a relational database.				It is a non-relational or document based database.

It can't store the data in key and value pair.		It stores the data in key and value pair.

Not suitable for hierarchical data storage. 		Suitable for hierarchical data storage.

It has a predefined(static) schema.			It has a dynamic schema.

It contains tables.					It contains collections.

It is row based.					It is document based.

It is column based.					It is field based.

It is slower.						It is faster.

It supports SQL query language.				It supports JSON query language.


PL/SQL
=======
PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language extension to Structure Query Language.

It is a extension of SQL and gives following features.

1) We can achieve programming features like control statements ,loops and etc.

2) It reduces network traffic.

3) We can display custom error messages by using the concept of exception handling.

4) We can perform related operations by using the concept of triggers.

5) We can save the source code permanently to database for repeated execution.


PL/SQL block
============
A PL/SQL program is also known as PL/SQL block.

syntax:
		DECLARE
		-
		- 	-- Declaration Section 
		-
		BEGIN
		-
		-	-- Execution Section
		-
		EXCEPTION
		-
		-	-- Exception Section
		-
		END
		/

		Here '/' is used to submit the PL/sQL block into a database.
