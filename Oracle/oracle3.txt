update command
===============
update command is used to update the values in a row.

syntax:
------
	update <table_name> set <col_name>=value where condition;

ex:
	update student set sname='rani' where sno=101;

	update student set sname='Alan',sadd='USA' where sno=103;

	commit;

	rollback;

Note:
-----
	If we are not using any where clause then all rows will be udpated.
	ex:
		update student set sname='raja';
		update student set sno=101;
		update student set sadd='hyd';



delete command
================
A delete command is used to delete the rows from database table.

syntax:
------
	delete from <table_name> where condition;

ex:
	delete from student where sno=101;
	delete from student where sname='ravi';
	delete from student where sadd='pune';
	commit;

Note:
-----
	If we won't use where clause then all rows will be deleted.
	ex:
		delete from student;
		delete from emp;
		delete from dept;


Interview Questions
====================

Q) Write a query to terminate all the employees those who are working as a Clerk?

	delete from emp where job='Clerk';



Q) Write a query to display employees information whose commision is null?

	select * from emp where comm is null;



Q) Write a query to increment salary by 1000 whose employee id is 201?

	update emp set esal=esal+1000 where eid=201;



Logical Operators
=================
Logical operators are used to declare multiple conditions in a query.

We have three logical opreators.

1) AND

2) OR 

3) NOT 


1) AND
-------
It returns the records only if our condition is true.

All conditions must be from same row only.

ex:
---
	select * from emp where eid=201 AND ename='Alan';

	select * from emp where eid=201 AND ename='Ana'; //no rows selected

	select * from emp where eid=201 AND ename='Jose';//no rows selected 

	
2) OR 
---------
It returns the records only if one condition is true.

Here conditions can be from any row.

ex:
--
	select * from emp where eid=201 OR ename='Alan';

	select * from emp where eid=201 OR ename='Ana'; 

	select * from emp where eid=201 OR ename='Jose';

3) NOT 
--------
It will return the records except the condition.

A <> symbol denoted as not operator.

ex:
	select * from emp where NOT eid=202;

	select * from emp where eid<>202;


	select * from emp where job<>'Manager';


Interview Queries
----------------
Q) Write a query to display employees information whose salary is greater then 
   20000 and less then 50000?

	select * from emp where esal>20000 AND esal<50000;	


Q) Write a query to display employees information those who are not working in 10 
   department?

   select * from emp where deptno<>10;



Q) Write a query to display employee information whose employee id is 201,202 and 203?

	select * from emp where eid=201 OR eid=202 OR eid=203;



Between operator
===============
Between operator returns the records those who are in the range of values.

In between operator we will take lower limit then higher limit.

ex:
	select * from student where sno between 101 and 105;

	select * from emp where esal between 5000 AND 20000;

	select * from emp where deptno between 10 AND 30;


IN operator
==============
IN operator is a replacement of OR operator.

In operator returns the records those who are matching in the list of values.

ex:
	select * from student where sno IN(101,102,103);

	select * from student where sname IN('raja','ravi','Alan');



Interview Queries
------------------

Q) Write a query to delete employees information whose employee id 201,202 and 203?

	delete from emp where eid IN (201,202,203);



Q) Write a query to display employees information whose deptno number between 10 to 30?

	select * from emp where deptno between 10 and 30;


Pattern Matching operators
===========================
Pattern matching operators are used to select the letters from table.

Pattern matching operators take the support of like keyword.

We have two type of pattern matching operators.

1) Percentage (%)

2) Underscore (_)


1) Percentage (%)
-----------------

Q) Write a query to display employees information whose emplyoee name starts with 'A' letter?

	select * from emp where ename like 'A%';


Q) Write a query to display employees information whose employee name ends with 'n' letter?

	select * from emp where ename like '%n';


Q) Write a query to display employees information whose employee name having middle letter
   as 'l' letter?

	select * from emp where ename like '%l%';


2) Underscore (_)
-----------------
Q) Write a query to display employee information whose employee name having second 
   letter as 'l'?

ex:
	select * from emp where ename like '_l%';



Q) Write a query to display employee information whose employee name having second 
   last letter as 's'?  
  
	select * from emp where ename like '%s_';


Q) WRite a query to display employee information whose employee name having third 
   letter as 'l' ?

	select * from emp where ename like '__l%';


DDL commands
=============
1) create (tables)
2) alter  (columns)
3) drop   (tables)
4) truncate  (records)
5) rename (tables)


drop command
==========
It is used to drop the table from database.

syntax:
	drop table <table_name>;
ex:
	drop table student;
	drop table dept;
	drop table emp; 


rename command
================
It is used to rename the table name.

syntax:
	rename <old_name> to <new_name>;
ex:
	rename student to students;
	rename emp to employees;
	rename dept to departments;

truncate command
===============
It is used to delete the records permanently.

syntax:
	truncate table <table_name>;

ex:
	truncate table student;
	truncate table emp;
	truncate table dept;



Q) What is the difference between delete and truncate command?

delete 					truncate 
--------				----------
It deletes the rocords temperory.	It delete the records permanently.

We can rollback the data.		We can't rollback the data.

Where clause can be used.		Where clause can't be used.
