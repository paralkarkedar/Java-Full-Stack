To see the output in PL/SQL we need to use below command.
ex:
	SQL> set  serveroutput  on 


Triggers
========
Trigger is a PL/SQL block which executes based on event.

Triggers events are insert, update and delete.

Triggers timings are before, after and insteadof.

syntax:
-------
	create or replace trigger <trigger_name> <timing> <event> on <object>
	begin
	-
	-
	-
	end;
	/

ex:
----
	create or replace trigger trg1 before insert on student
	begin
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Thanks for Inserting');
	END;
	/

	insert into student values(104,'ramulu','pune');

ex:
----
	create or replace trigger trg2 after delete on student
	begin
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Thanks for deleting');
	END;
	/

	delete from student where sno=104;


It is possible to declare multiple events in a single trigger.

ex:

	create or replace trigger trg3 after update or delete or insert on student
	begin
	IF inserting then 
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Thanks for Insert');
	elsif updating then 
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Thanks for update');
	else
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Thanks for delete');
	END IF;
	END;
	/

	update student set sname='rani' where sname='raja';

	delete from student where sno=103;

	insert into student values(104,'ramulu','pune');

Triggers are divided into two types.

1) Statement level trigger 

2) Row level trigger 


1) Statement level trigger 
-----------------------
In statement level trigger , our trigger will execute only for one time irrespective of number of 
records effecting in a database table.

By default every trigger is a statement level trigger.

ex:
	create or replace trigger trg4 before delete on student
	begin
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Deleted!!!');
	END;
	/

	 delete from student;

2) Row level trigger
-----------------------
In row level trigger, our trigger will execute irrespective of number of records effected in a database table.

We can create a row level trigger by using "for each row" clause.

ex:
	
	create or replace trigger trg5 before delete on student FOR EACH ROW
	begin
	DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Deleted!!!');
	END;
	/

	 delete from student; //trigger will execute multiple times 


Q) Write a query to display list of triggers present in database?

	select object_name from user_objects where object_type='TRIGGER';



Q) Write a query to see the source code of a trigger?

	select text from user_source where name='TRG5';


Q) Write a query to drop the trigger?

	drop trigger trg1;
	drop trigger trg2;
	drop trigger trg3;
	drop trigger trg4;
	drop trigger trg5;
