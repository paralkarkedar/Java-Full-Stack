Limitations with Spring Framework
==================================
In spring framework a programmer is responsible for following things.

1) Adding dependencies or jar files.

2) Performing configuration in applicationContext.xml file.

3) Arranging physical server like Tomcat.

4) Managing physical database like Oracle, MySQL and etc.

To overcome above limitations we need to use Spring Boot.

ex:
		Developer
		   |
		   |
		Spring Boot
		   |
		   |
		Spring Framework 


Spring Boot
============
It is an open source java based application framework developed by Pivotal Team.

It provides RAD (Rapid Application development) features for spring based applications.

It is a standalone, production ready grade spring based applications with minimum configurations.

In short, spring boot is a combination of 

ex:
	Spring framework 	+	Embedded Server		+	Embedded Database 

Spring Boot does not support xml configurations instead it will use annotations.

Advantages of Spring Boot
=========================
> It is used to develop standalone applications which can run by using java -jar.

> It gives production ready grade features like metrics, Health check , Externalized configurations and etc.

> It provides optionate starters to simplify the maven development process.

> It allows us to test web applications by using HTTP servers like Tomcat, Jetty and Undertow.

> It provides in memory databases like H2, HSQL and Derby.

> It does not support xml configurations.

> It contains CLI (Command Line Interface) tool for developing and testing spring boot applications.

Q) What is the difference between Spring Framework and Spring Boot?

Spring Framework					Spring Boot
--------------------					-------------
It is a leight weight open source framework		It is built on top of spring framework 
widely used to develop enterprise applications.		widely used to develop REST API's.

A programmer is responsible to add dependencies.	A spring boot starter component is responsible
							to add dependencies.

The main feature of spring framework is dependency	The main feature of spring boot is auto  
injection.						configuration.

It is used to develop loosely coupled applications.	It is used to develop standalone applications.

It does not provide in-memory databases.		It provides in-memory databases.



Q) How many components are there in spring boot?

We have four components in spring boot.

1) AutoConfiguration 

2) Starters 

3) Actuators 

4) CLI Tool 


Q) What is dependency injection?

A dependency injection is a programming technique which makes our class independent to it's dependencies.

In dependency injection one object gives dependencies of another.

To perform dependency injection in spring boot we will use @Autowired annotation.

If one class need dependency of another class then we need to use dependency injection.

ex:
	class Recording 
	{
		-
		- // Recording related logic 
		-
	}	
	class Student 
	{
		@Autowired
		Recording r;	
	}


Q) In how many ways we can create a spring boot project?

There are two ways to create spring boot project.

1) Using Spring Intializr 

2) Using IDE's (IntellIJ/ STS (Spring Tool Suit))



Q) What is Spring Initializr?

It is a web-based tool that helps developers to create and set up Spring Boot project or structure.
